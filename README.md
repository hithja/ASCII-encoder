# ASCII ENCODER AND DECODER
Change `let str = "Hello, World! This code was wrote by neon68 (aka neon68dev)";` to your string then do this:
- Write `node index` in your console and your string will be converted to HEX code!
- Write `node index decode` in your console and your string will be converted from HEX to ASCII!
